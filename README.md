# retest

relearning github all over again!

This is a space where I can explore my skills with Github again before I use it in the classroom!
It's been a couple years since Ic created my first site on Gibthub, but I'm confident it'll be even better the second time around!

I have to be patient with myself, though.

In any case, HELLO WORLD!
